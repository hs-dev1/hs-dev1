## 👋 About Me

I’m a **senior software engineer** with years of experience building and scaling **real-world products** — not demos, not experiments.

I focus on:
- Clean architecture
- Long-term maintainability
- Systems that scale
- Calm, predictable software

I use AI as a **multiplier**, guided by engineering judgment earned through experience.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

> Good software feels boring — because it just works.

- Fundamentals outlive frameworks  
- Architecture matters more than hype  
- Experience turns tools into leverage  
- AI accelerates work — judgment ensures quality
